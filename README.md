Hello my name is Steven Nguyen, I am a first year at Pasadena City College studying Computer Science & Mathematics! I intend to transfer in the Fall of 2024 and study either Computer Science & Business or Computer Science & Mathematics. This project is my first foray into web development, prior to this I have only been really familiar with the foundations of C++, Java, and Python. Through this project, I was able to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, I did attempt to learn javascript and implement in my website as well but ultimately found my understanding had been weak given the time span and my scheduling to properly utilize it. 

However, I didn't let that stop me from utilizing my new knowledge of HTML and CSS to my best ability. This was also my first exploration of github and github pages!

I decided to base my website on a small record labeled owned by my favorite DJ, RL GRIME. I wanted to showcase my love for music as well as make the website as interactive as possible in order to drive users to explore the page and listen to the music through embed links and hyperlinks that would give you access to actual events, merchandise, and link you directly to the spotify song/artist page! I believe that the key to any good application or business model is something that catches the user's eyes and makes them want to explore beyond what is just shown outright! I am very proud of what I was able to push out and I'd argue it is even more stunning on mobile devices!

I personally did not use a template but utilized researches such as
